This project implements a responsive blog layout using CSS Grid and Sticky Sidebar.

Features
Responsive Grid Layout
Sticky Sidebar Navigation
Dummy Blog Posts
✅ Requirements:

Layout Structure (using CSS Grid): Create a grid layout with: A Header at the top spanning full width
A Sidebar on the left (for navigation links)

A Main content area on the right

A Footer at the bottom spanning full width

| Header | | Sidebar | Main | | Footer |

Use grid-template-areas or grid-template-columns/rows to achieve this.

Sidebar with Sticky Navigation (using position: sticky): Inside the sidebar: Add a vertical list of 5 blog post titles or categories
Use position: sticky so this menu stays visible when the user scrolls the main content

Main Content: Add 4–5 sections of dummy blog content (can use h2 and p).
Each section should have enough content to allow scrolling.

Styling: Use different background colors for Header, Sidebar, Main Content, and Footer
Add padding and spacing for readability

Make sure layout is responsive for smaller screens (use minmax() or media queries optionally)
